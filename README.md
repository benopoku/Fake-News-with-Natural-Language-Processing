Detecting Fake and True News with Natural Language Processing
We mostly get our news from a variety of sources throughout the day, but it can be difficult to tell which ones are fake and which are genuine. So, the question is, do you trust all of the news you get from online media? Every piece of news we consume is not true or false. If you listen to fake news, you are gathering incorrect information from the world, which can have a negative impact on society because a person's views or thoughts can change after consuming fake news that the user believes to be true. Because not all news we encounter in our daily lives is authentic, how do we determine whether the news is fake or real? In this article, we will focus on text-based news and attempt to build a model that will assist us in determining whether a given piece of news is fake or real.
